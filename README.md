# EPIGRAPHY-CLUB-2015
A volunteer group of students creating Leiden-compliant, EpiDoc editions of the unpublished Latin &amp; Greek inscriptions at Columbia's Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library

##Workflow
1) Each file may only be branched from the master by ONE collaborator at a time (Person A).
2) A marks up the edition, saving each commit with clear description and flagging issues for discussion.~
3) A then requests feedback from others (Persons B, C) by pull request, committing changes as necessary.
3) A final edition is merged mutatis mutandis to the master and marked as MARKEDUP.
4) Repeat for every file.

~ We will need to come up with ideas about best practices here -- something intuitive but standardized which we will want to query, organize, or search for later on....
