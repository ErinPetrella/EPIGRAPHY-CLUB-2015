# EPIGRAPHY-CLUB-2015
A volunteer group of students creating Leiden-compliant, EpiDoc editions of the unpublished Latin &amp; Greek inscriptions at Columbia's Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library

##Workflow
_(Adapted from: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow-in-the-browser/ <-- Follow the steps at each point.)_
```
1. A new file is uploaded to the Github repository from the DropBox folder.
2. Person (A) creates a new branch (named after that file and the iteration: e.g. the first attempt to branch #422 would be "icolbutler-422-1"; the 2nd attempt to branch #26 is "icolbutler-26-2"). **Each file may only be branched from the master by ONE collaborator at a time.**
3. (A) marks up the edition, saving each commit with a clear and intuitive title and description, and flagging issues for discussion with the group.
4. (A) then requests feedback from others (Persons B, C) by pull request, committing their changes as necessary.
5. (A) merges the final edition _mutatis mutandis_ to the master and marked as MARKEDUP.
6. Repeat for every file.
```
n.b. We will need to come up with ideas about best practices for communication -- something intuitive but standardized which we will want to query, organize, or search for later on. The Golden Rule is: write titles and descriptions with the clarity and diligence that you would love others to do for you.
